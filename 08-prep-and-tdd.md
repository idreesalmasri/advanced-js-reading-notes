### role-based access control
RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization.

### RBAC definition
RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. The system needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs. Access is then assigned to each person based strictly on their role assignment.

### Benefits of RBAC
With the proper implementation of RBAC, the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.
it can in reality be easy to implement, and will make the ongoing management of access rights much easier and more secure.

### RBAC vs. ABAC vs. ACL
An ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document.
ACL could be used to allow users from one department to make changes to a document, while only allowing users from other departments to read the document.

### Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
can use a variety of attributes, including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required, etc. to determine whether a user’s access request should be granted.

### RBAC implementation
five-step approach to getting it implemented:
- Inventory your systems 
- Analyze your workforce and create roles 
- Assign people to roles
- Never make one-off changes
- Audit

### Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:

- Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.
- Role authorization:A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject.
- Permission authorization :  A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role.


### When defining an RBAC model, the following conventions are useful:

- S = Subject = A person or automated agent
- R = Role = Job function or title which defines an authority level
- P = Permissions = An approval of a mode of access to a resource
- SE = Session = A mapping involving S, R and/or P
- SA = Subject Assignment
- PA = Permission Assignment
- RH = Partially ordered Role Hierarchy. RH can also be written: ≥ (The notation: x ≥ y means - that x inherits the permissions of y.)
- A subject can have multiple roles.
- A role can have multiple subjects.
- A role can have many permissions.
- A permission can be assigned to many roles.
- An operation can be assigned to many permissions.
- A permission can be assigned to many operations.
