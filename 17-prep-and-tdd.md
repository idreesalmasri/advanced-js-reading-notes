## Amazon S3
How it works
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can store and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case, such as data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile apps. With cost-effective storage classes and easy-to-use management features, you can optimize costs, organize data, and configure fine-tuned access controls to meet specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.

Use cases
- Build a data lake
- Back up and restore critical data
- Archive data at the lowest cost
Run cloud-native applications
S3 storage classes are purpose-built to provide the lowest cost storage for different access patterns. S3 storage classes are ideal for virtually any use case, including those with demanding performance needs, data residency requirements, unknown or changing access patterns, or archival storage.

Key Features:S3 Standard
- Low latency and high throughput performance
- Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
- Resilient against events that impact an entire Availability Zone
- Designed for 99.99% availability over a given year
- Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest
- S3 Lifecycle management for automatic migration of objects to other S3 Storage Classes  


### AWS Lambda
What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.
The Lambda functions can perform any kind of computing task, from serving web pages and processing streams of data to calling APIs and integrating with other AWS services.

When building Serverless applications, AWS Lambda is one of the main candidates for running the application code. Typically, to complete a Serverless stack you’ll need:

- a computing service;
- a database service; and
- an HTTP gateway service.

Benefits of using AWS Lambda
- Pay per use. In AWS Lambda, you pay only for the compute your functions use, plus any network traffic generated.
- Fully managed infrastructure. Now that your functions run on the managed AWS infrastructure, you don’t need to think about the underlying servers—AWS takes care of this for you.
- Automatic scaling. AWS Lambda creates the instances of your function as they are requested.
