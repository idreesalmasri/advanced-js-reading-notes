# Ethics in Tech
## 1-GENERAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES
- 1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
- 1.2 Avoid harm. In this document, "harm" means negative consequences, especially when those consequences are significant and unjust.  
- 1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.A computing professional should be transparent and provide full disclosure of all pertinent system capabilities, limitations, and potential problems to the appropriate parties. Making deliberately false or misleading claims, fabricating or falsifying data, offering or accepting bribes, and other dishonest conduct are violations of the Code.
- 1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate.The values of equality, tolerance, respect for others, and justice govern this principle. Fairness requires that even careful decision processes provide some avenue for redress of grievances.
- 1.5 Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.
- 1.6 Respect privacy.The responsibility of respecting privacy applies to computing professionals in a particularly profound way. Technology enables the collection, monitoring, and exchange of personal information quickly, inexpensively, and often without the knowledge of the people affected.
- 1.7 Honor confidentiality.
## 2. PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.
- 2.1 Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work.
- 2.2 Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice.
- 2.3 Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work.
- 2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review.
- 2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.
- 2.6 Perform work only in areas of competence.
- 2.7 Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.
- 2.8 Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good.
- 2.9 Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure.
## 3. PROFESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES.
- 3.1 Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.
- 3.2 Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization or group.
- 3.3 Manage personnel and resources to enhance the quality of working life.
- 3.4 Articulate, apply, and support policies and processes that reflect the principles of the Code.
- 3.5 Create opportunities for members of the organization or group to grow as professionals.
- 3.6 Use care when modifying or retiring systems.
- 3.7 Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society.
## 4. COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE.
- 4.1 Uphold, promote, and respect the principles of the Code.
- 4.2 Treat violations of the Code as inconsistent with membership in the ACM.
